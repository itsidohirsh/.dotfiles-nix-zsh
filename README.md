# .dotfiles
All my .dotfiles in one place ðŸ˜€

Easily set up a development environment on a fresh machine!

- This ðŸ’¡ was initialized and taken from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70YMTHAZyy4&list=PL1C97G3GhlHdANMFUIXTcFr14R7b7EBj9&ab_channel=JakeWiesler) **awesome** series!

## Installation steps

1. Clone this repository to your `home` directory
2. `cd .dotfiles`
3. Make sure `install.sh` has execution premmisions
4. Run `./install.sh`
5. Open new terminal window to initiate `zsh` shell

And that's it ðŸ˜œ

### Small issues

- installing `nvim` plugins in `--headless` causes error output, but **doesn't** break installation
